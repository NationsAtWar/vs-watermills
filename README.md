# vs-watermills
A mod that adds watermills to Vintage Story

Craft a watermill with some planks, resin, fat, a hammer, and a chisel. Place on any wall with a 3x3 clearance, and then power with water flow.
You can attach axles to either side of the watermill. The more water flowing into the mill, the faster it will turn.
